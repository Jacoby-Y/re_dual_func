		/* 2 */ `After a lot of research, I figured out how to multiply my Mana output. Basically, I rip a hole in spacetime and pull out my Mana's multiversal counterpart. Or, something like that. I'm a wizard, not a scientist!`,
		/* 3 */ `You like combos right? No, not the snack you buy at the gas station. Like, a combo in a video game? Well, I figured that out! Basically the same idea as the Mana multiplication I talked about before.`,
		/* 4 */ `"Sometimes you need to start over to realize how far you were," said the old guy that sold me this "Prestige-O-Matic" machine. Who even names these things?`,
		/* 5 */ `Power. I need more power. It's too tempting not to take over these weak people along with their planet. Don't worry, I'll leave your house alone Dad.`,
		/* 6 */ `I talked to the Gods. They gave me Ichor for the cores of the ruined planets I take over, but at a multi-universal cost.`,
		/* 7 */ `I did it! I've created my own realm. Now there can finally be a realm where politics aren't corrupt and pizza doesn't make you fat!`,
		/* 8 */ `Hey, Dad, guess where I am. Yep, you guessed it (probably). I'm at the counsel of The 9 Gods! I bought one of their seats (these guys are easy to bribe). You don't need to worry about bad harvests anymore!`,
		/* 9 */ `What is a universe to a man who's experienced everything. What is a life to a man that doesn't know what it means to live anymore? I can't start over; I can't prestige, I can't live; I can't die. To create; to destroy. To create destruction. Goodbye, Dad, I love you.`
