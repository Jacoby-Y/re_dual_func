ToDo List:
- menu for cores (maybe toggle between which type of core you want to grind for?)
- show base stats (maybe in a menu somewhere? no s√©)
- ichor upgrade that gives more ichor per planet core
- a journal giving lore and info about the game
- max buy ichor upgrades
- ichor upgrades increase in cost per purchase
- turn prestige time seconds into minutes/hours/days
- prestige button shows after other buttons
- realm button between power bar and mana to power text

With enough planet cores you can create a realm and idley gain ichor
With enough ichor you can buy the position of each of The 9 Gods
Once you buy all The 9 Gods' position, you own the universe.
